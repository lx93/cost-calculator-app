the aim of this application is to calculate the cost of driving an ev/ICE on long road trips. Given the high cost of DC fast charging seen recently especially in states like California, it is often cheaper to drive a ICE vehicle with decent fuel efficiency.

The following inputs are needed to do the calculation:
type of EV (or alternatively manually enter mi/kwh)
type of ICE (or alterntively mpg)
electricity cost
gas price
distance
